FIXME:

o The analytic type is much more involved since there are two parameters
  -> need to figure it all out ^^

o K has negative weight, for the homogeneous weight polynomial it is easier to
  work with positive weights, so for now the weight of K is set to 1 instead
  of -1

o The assumption for numerator/denominator is that they are holomorphic (in
  tau), is it still possible to maintain this assumption?

o Is K resp. J1 even modular?? ep=?
